# IGR202 Course Project : Real-time volumetric cloud rendering
*By Telo PHILIPPE*  
This is my project for my IGR course in Telecom Paris. My goal is to render real time volumetric clouds, using volume raymarching in a deferred pipeline.  
I re-used some boilerplate code from the first practical project of this class (Interactive solar system), and adapted it to allow deferred rendering.
